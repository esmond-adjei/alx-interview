Here's how it works:

1. **Copy All:** You can make a copy of what you have drawn.

2. **Paste:** You can paste the copied drawing.

Now, let's say you want to draw 4 "H"s. Here's what happens step by step:

- Draw 1 "H" (initial state).
- **Copy All:** You make a copy of the "H".
- **Paste:** You paste the copy next to the original "H".
- Now, you have 2 "H"s.
- **Copy All:** You make a copy of the 2 "H"s.
- **Paste:** You paste the copy next to the existing "H"s.
- Now, you have 4 "H"s.

So, the minimum number of actions (operations) to draw 4 "H"s is 2.

Similarly, for drawing 12 "H"s:

- Draw 1 "H" (initial state).
- **Copy All:** You make a copy of the "H".
- **Paste:** You paste the copy next to the original "H".
- Now, you have 2 "H"s.
- **Copy All:** You make a copy of the 2 "H"s.
- **Paste:** You paste the copy next to the existing "H"s.
- Now, you have 4 "H"s.
- **Copy All:** You make a copy of the 4 "H"s.
- **Paste:** You paste the copy next to the existing "H"s.
- Now, you have 8 "H"s.
- **Paste:** You paste the last copy next to the existing "H"s.
- Now, you have 12 "H"s.

So, the minimum number of actions (operations) to draw 12 "H"s is 7.

In simple terms, the solution finds the quickest way to draw a certain number of "H"s using the magical pencil and its special actions.
